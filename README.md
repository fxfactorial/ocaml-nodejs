These are [js\_of\_ocaml](https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml) bindings to [nodejs](https://github.com/nodejs/node)

As a general proof of concept you can
do:

1.  `make`
2.  `node chat_server.js`

and open up localhost:8080, you'll have a working `Node` server.

Get all the power of the `Node` ecosystem while still getting the
sanity and type safety of `OCaml`.

# Issues

`Node` has a pretty big API so its going to take me a little bit of
time to cover the API.
